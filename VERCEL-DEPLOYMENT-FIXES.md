# Vercel Deployment Issues - Fixed ✅

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Git Merge Conflict in `.gitignore` (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The `.gitignore` file had unresolved merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
**Impact:** This corrupted file could cause deployment failures.
**Status:** **FIXED** - Removed all merge conflict markers and cleaned up the file.

### 2. ✅ Vercel Configuration Issues
**Problem:** `vercel.json` had unnecessary complexity with PHP references and outdated build configuration. Also missing `outputDirectory` setting causing "No Output Directory named 'public' found" error.
**Impact:** Vercel doesn't support PHP well, and without `outputDirectory: "."` it looks for a `public` folder that doesn't exist.
**Status:** **FIXED** - Added `outputDirectory: "."` to tell Vercel files are in root directory, removed PHP references, and added proper caching headers.

### 3. ✅ Missing `.vercelignore`
**Problem:** No `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment.
**Impact:** Larger deployment size and potential conflicts.
**Status:** **FIXED** - Created `.vercelignore` to exclude development files.

### 4. ⚠️ Large SVG Files with Embedded Images (CRITICAL - REQUIRES MANUAL FIX)
**Problem:** 
- `logo.svg`: **989 KB** (contains embedded base64 PNG image)
- `footer-logo.svg`: **843 KB** (contains embedded base64 PNG image)

**Impact:** These files are causing the images not to show on Vercel because:
- They're too large for efficient loading
- Embedded base64 images in SVG are inefficient
- May timeout or fail to load on Vercel's CDN

**Solution Required:** You need to either:
1. **Convert SVG to PNG/WebP** (recommended)
2. **Optimize the SVG** by removing embedded images
3. **Use a CDN** like Cloudinary or ImgIx for large images

### 5. ⚠️ Large Video File
**Problem:** `hero-vid.mp4` is **2.04 MB**
**Impact:** May be slow to load or timeout on Vercel's free tier.

**Solution Options:**
1. **Use external video hosting** (YouTube, Vimeo, Cloudinary)
2. **Compress the video** further
3. **Use a poster image** and lazy load the video

## What You Need to Do

### CRITICAL: Fix Large SVG Files

**Option 1: Convert to PNG (Easiest)**
```bash
# Use an online tool or image editor to convert:
# logo.svg → logo.png (optimize to < 200KB)
# footer-logo.svg → footer-logo.png (optimize to < 200KB)
```

Then update in `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Change from: -->
<img src="assets/images/logo.svg" alt="Tac Visual Prints Logo" class="logo h-12 w-auto">

<!-- To: -->
<img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="Tac Visual Prints Logo" class="logo h-12 w-auto">
```

**Option 2: Use Cloudinary (Best for Production)**
1. Sign up for free at https://cloudinary.com
2. Upload your images
3. Replace image URLs with Cloudinary URLs

**Option 3: Optimize SVG Files**
Use https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ to remove embedded images and optimize

### RECOMMENDED: Optimize Video

**Option 1: Use External Hosting**
Upload to YouTube/Vimeo and embed:
```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" ...></iframe>
```

**Option 2: Compress Video**
Use HandBrake or online tools to compress to < 1MB

**Option 3: Use Cloudinary**
Upload video to Cloudinary for automatic optimization

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Fixed `.gitignore` merge conflicts
- [x] Optimized `vercel.json`
- [x] Created `.vercelignore`
- [ ] **Replace or optimize large SVG files** (YOU MUST DO THIS)
- [ ] **Optimize or externally host video** (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Test deployment on Vercel
- [ ] Verify images and videos load correctly

---

## How to Deploy to Vercel

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it as a static site
   - Deploy!

3. **After deployment:**
   - Check if images load
   - Check if video loads
   - Test on mobile devices

## Why Images/Videos Weren't Showing

1. **Git merge conflict** in `.gitignore` may have caused deployment issues
2. **Large SVG files** (1MB each) with embedded base64 images are too large and inefficient
3. **Incorrect Vercel config** with PHP references
4. **No caching headers** for static assets
5. **Large video file** (2MB) may timeout on free tier

---

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT:** Replace the SVG files with optimized PNG/WebP versions
2. **RECOMMENDED:** Move video to external hosting or compress it
3. **Commit and push** all changes
4. **Redeploy** to Vercel
5. **Test** that everything works

## Need Help?

If images still don't show after fixing the SVG files:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file paths are correct (case-sensitive on Linux/Vercel)
3. Check Vercel deployment logs
4. Ensure files are committed to Git (not in `.gitignore`)
